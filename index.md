## Bio Abstract and Website Intent

This website is to feature my professional accomplishments, portfolio contents, resume, and other professional accomplishments.

I am a curriculum developer, editor, educator, researcher and author in my professional life. I spent much of my early adult professional career in Secondary public classrooms teaching English, Creative Writing, and sponsoring more clubs and extracurriculars than I can remember. I progressed out of the secondary classroom into the collegiate classroom and even further as a Curriculum Design Specialist for University. My time in the collegiate world allowed me to write content for courses, teach courses, and design courses with other professors in multiple departments through close collaboration. When given the opportunity, I moved from the world of academia to the business sector as a Director of Curriculum Development. In this position my knowledge and skills surrounding curriculum expanded beyond what I learned in the world academia to include the health care industry, business industry basics, video editing and development, various coding languages, and further developed my skills in collaboration and managing and completing multiple tasks with various departments simultaneously. 

I have recently launched [LW - Learning and Knowledge Consulting](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyKRYDndOS6lVgMwnX4ls1g/featured) where I am working to create a community of knowledge and learning in both the academic and corporate world. My hope is that I will provide various levels of learning and knowledge types, techniques, approaches, theories, methodologies, and stories that I have found to be successful through experience, research, and implementation. Professionals from various fields associated with education, communication, learning, knowledge, and curriculum will also be featured in a video series. These professionals are from the academic and corporate worlds. I believe that providing professional examples of how learning and communication techniques from those in desired fields actively practicing is extraordinarily valuable. *LW - Learning and Knowledge Consulting is currently in the Pre-Launch phase*

## My Professional Mission

I challenge myself to develop curriculum that reaches all levels of learners and busy professionals in the academic and corporate environments. I have experience designing curriculum at the secondary and collegiate levels as well as in the academic and profressional sectors. I continue to grow in my field by giving presentations on curriculum and training at the industry, local, and national levels, and through continuing research allowing me to stay up to date with education and curriculum trends.

## Example Training Videos and Scripts

| Video Name     | Script     | Description or Notes|
| -------------- |----------- | ----------- |
| [Sample Creating A Voice Recording in Camtasia Video](https://github.com/laurieward333/laurieward333.github.io/blob/main/Sample%20Creating%20A%20Voice%20Recording%20In%20Camtasia%20Video.mp4) | [Script Available](https://github.com/laurieward333/laurieward333.github.io/blob/main/Sample%20Script%20for%20Creating%20a%20Voice%20Recording%20in%20Camtasia%20Video.pdf) | This is an example of a "How To" or "click path" journey through a product. This basic example shows the importance of the sequence of steps, exact language and descriptions that would be used so a User can watch or choose to listen and work simultaneously with the video. |
| [Sample Video: How to Write An Objective](https://www.screencast.com/t/JKlg8RAmLpr)  | No Script | This is an example of what it may look like to have me do a live training in front of your department. Please note that handouts, pens, candy, and pauses for breaks and questions would be taken in a real setting. Participants would also be given an agenda and time estimate for the training prior to attending. Additionally, most trainings would be recorded and turned into a shorter version, such as the Power Point version listed below. |
| [Sample Video: How to Write an Objective - Recorded for a Learning Management System](https://github.com/laurieward333/laurieward333.github.io/blob/main/Sample%20Demo%20of%20Objective%20Writing%20Lesson%20-%20Power%20Point%20Version.mp4) | Script Unavailable, but [Power Point slide deck is available](https://github.com/laurieward333/laurieward333.github.io/blob/main/Sample_How%20to%20Write%20Objectives_Video%20with%20PP.pptx) | This is an example of how I can take a live training and manipulate and shorten the training session to hit the highlights for the purposes of a training that may be placed in a Learning Management System for those who are unable to attend the live training.  This way, all participants receive the same training materials. |
| [Sample Video: How to Write an Objective - Includes Built In Assessment](https://www.screencast.com/t/ZTcfxNDwYbVU) |Script Unavailable, but [Power Point slide deck is available](https://github.com/laurieward333/laurieward333.github.io/blob/main/Sample_How%20to%20Write%20Objectives_Video%20with%20PP.pptx) | This type of training video can be placed in an LMS or can be used as a stand alone assessment tool.  A report is generated and sent to the creator of the video (me) to be shared with stakeholders as necessary and to help shape future curriculum development |
