## Bio Abstract and Website Intent ##

This website is to feature my professional accomplishments, portfolio contents, resume, and other professional accomplishments.

I am a curriculum developer, editor, educator, researcher and author in my professional life. I spent much of my early adult professional career in Secondary public classrooms teaching English, Creative Writing, and sponsoring more clubs and extracurriculars than I can remember. I progressed out of the secondary classroom into the collegiate classroom and even further as a Curriculum Design Specialist for University. My time in the collegiate world allowed me to write content for courses, teach courses, and design courses with other professors in multiple departments through close collaboration. When given the opportunity, I moved from the world of academia to the business sector as a Director of Curriculum Development. In this position my knowledge and skills surrounding curriculum expanded beyond what I learned in the world academia to include the health care industry, business industry basics, video editing and development, various coding languages, and further developed my skills in collaboration and managing and completing multiple tasks with various departments simultaneously. 

In my personal life I am a mom, wife, artist, singer, and nature enthusiast. I spend many nights and weekends watching my daughter on the soccer field as a defender or keeper. When I'm not cheering on the sidelines, I am usually found with a sketch pad and pencil, charcoal, paints, soldering iron, dremel tool, or with a notebook or my computer journaling or writing on my next book. I do enjoy taking time to walk barefoot in the grass or close my eyes and let the sun warm my face, but one of my favorite places to be outside is in a kayak on a lazy river. My rescue dog, Stella and I also enjoy singing together to our favorite songs. My husband and best friend supports my eclectic hobbies and usually joins me on my adventures. 

I volunteered with a local animal rescue, fostering 13 little puppies until Stella decided she didn't like being a big sister anymore. I enjoyed fundraising and taking pictures with the rescue in the time that volunteered with them. I also served on my daughter's school PTA as the website manager for 1.5 years. 

I have recently launched [LW - Learning and Knowledge Consulting](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyKRYDndOS6lVgMwnX4ls1g/featured) where I am working to create a community of knowledge and learning in both the academic and corporate world. My hope is that I will provide various levels of learning and knowledge types, techniques, approaches, theories, methodologies, and stories that I have found to be successful through experience, research, and implementation. Professionals from various fields associated with education, communication, learning, knowledge, and curriculum will also be featured in a video series. These professionals are from the academic and corporate worlds. I believe that providing professional examples of how learning and communication techniques from those in desired fields actively practicing is extraordinarily valuable. *LW - Learning and Knowledge Consulting is currently in the Pre-Launch phase*

## My Professional Mission ##

I challenge myself to develop curriculum that reaches all levels of learners and busy professionals in the academic and corporate environments. I have experience designing curriculum at the secondary and collegiate levels as well as in the academic and profressional sectors. I continue to grow in my field by giving presentations on curriculum and training at the industry, local, and national levels, and through continuing research allowing me to stay up to date with education and curriculum trends.
